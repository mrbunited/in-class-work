  In nature, dead trees are just as normal as live trees. Let that brush dance around there and play. You could sit here for weeks with your one hair brush trying to do that - or you could do it with one stroke with an almighty brush. This is your world, whatever makes you happy you can put in it. Go crazy. This is unplanned it really just happens.

And that's when it becomes fun - you don't have to spend your time thinking about what's happening - you just let it happen. We'll put all the little clouds in and let them dance around and have fun. Maybe he has a little friend that lives right over here. You create the dream - then you bring it into your world. Don't fight it, use what happens.

That's the way I look when I get home late; black and blue. Work on one thing at a time. Don't get carried away - we have plenty of time. Just let go - and fall like a little waterfall.

That's what painting is all about. It should make you feel good when you paint. See how easy it is to create a little tree right in your world. There isn't a rule. You just practice and find out which way works best for you.

I'm sort of a softy, I couldn't shoot Bambi except with a camera. Water's like me. It's laaazyÂ ... Boy, it always looks for the easiest way to do things Brown is such a nice color. Everybody needs a friend. You can do it.

Put light against light - you have nothing. Put dark against dark - you have nothing. It's the contrast of light and dark that each give the other one meaning. You need the dark in order to show the light. Let the paint work. Just beat the devil out of it. Anytime you learn something your time and energy are not wasted.

A beautiful little sunset. These things happen automatically. All you have to do is just let them happen. Let's go up in here, and start having some fun A little happy sunlight shining through there. This is where you take out all your hostilities and frustrations. It's better than kicking the puppy dog around and all that so.
